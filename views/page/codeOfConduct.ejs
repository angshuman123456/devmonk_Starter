    <h2>The following Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics shall be applicable to office bearers and members of all categories of the Society: </h2>
Members should at all times preserve the dignity and interest of the profession and of the Society by maintaining a high standard of professional and personal conduct;
They should work in the best interest of the Society;
They should neither engage in personal advertisement, nor canvas for an appointment, nor take any action which is detrimental;
They should at all times endeavour to establish and maintain the best possible conditions of service for their colleagues and other staff;
When a Member represents the Society, he should as far as possible state the policy of the Society. If he has any disagreement with a policy of the Society, he may so inform the Society. The Executive Council will then decide the further course of action (including the question of the Societyâ€™s representation) that is to be taken.
Where, having regard to this Code of Conduct a Member wishes to make a complaint against another Member of the Society, he should do so in writing to the Executive Council. If the Executive Council is of the opinion that prima-facie case of infringement of the Code of Conduct has been established it will appoint a Committee for investigation. On the basis of the report of the Committee, the Executive Council will take a final decision on the matter.
