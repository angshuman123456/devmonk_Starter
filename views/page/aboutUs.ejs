          We at HUM aspire to plant HUM Trees in various colleges throughout India. Planting the
          HUM Trees provide youth a platform to build a practical approach by promoting
          “Learning by Doing” through various fun and activity based modules. We will work to
          provide interactive sessions and conduct events that promote Team Work and Collective
          learning. We will lay special emphasis on values and ethics building to ensure more
          collaboration and less competition among the students. HUM Tree is a way of planting
          hopes among the students. We wish to collaborate with the students so as to learn, grow
          and blossom together.
